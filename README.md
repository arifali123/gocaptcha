# gocaptcha
An API wrapper for popular captcha solvers such as AntiCaptcha and 2Captcha in Golang

## Installation
Run the following command in your project folder:
``go get github.com/justhyped/gocaptcha``

## Support
| Type              | 2Captcha | AntiCaptcha | CapMonster Cloud |
|:------------------|:---------|:------------|:-----------------|
 | RecaptchaV2       | ✅        | ✅           | ✅                |
 | RecaptchaV3       | ✅        | ✅           | ✅                |
| Image Recaptcha   | ✅        | ✅           | ✅                |
| HCaptcha          | ✅        | ✅           | ✅                |

Software like XEVil and CapMonster are also supported, but it gets a little trickier.
Such software runs on a local ip:port so you must specify that with `CustomServiceUrl` 
(don't include the protocol as it defaults to http)

If you intend to use XEVil or CapMonster with this program you should check which API it supports (Either 2Captcha or AntiCaptcha).
Don't forget to add firewall rules and host the captcha software on a public port when using
XEVil or CapMonster between different machines.
